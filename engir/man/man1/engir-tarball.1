.SH DESCRIPTION
This article describes a suite of related \fBengir\fR(1) commands used to
create executable installers from source packages.  When invoked, the
\fIsource\fR package is wrapped in an installer script.  The installer is
written to the current directory by default, but this can controlled using
the \fB--output=\fR\fIfile\fR option.

The format of the \fIsource\fR package depends on the specific tool which is
invoked.  For \fBengir npm\fR, the \fIsource\fR should be a package generated
with \fBnpm pack\fR.  For \fBengir tarball\fR, the \fIsource\fR should be a
tarball containing paths relative to \fB/usr/local/\fR.
